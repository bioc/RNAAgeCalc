\title{Calculate RNA age using SummarizedExperiment}
\usage{
predict_age_fromse(
  se,
  tissue,
  exprtype = "FPKM",
  idtype = "SYMBOL",
  stype = "all",
  signature = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{se}{a \code{\link{SummarizedExperiment}} object. The assays(se) should
contain gene expression data. The name of assays(se) should be either "FPKM"
or "counts". Use `exprtype` argument to specify the type of gene expression 
data provided. Users are able to provide the chronological age of samples
using colData(se). This is optional. If provided, the column name for 
chronological age in colData(se) should be "age". If some samples' 
chronological age are not available, users are expected to set the 
chronological age in colData(se) to NA. If chronological age is not 
provided, the age acceleration residual will not be calculated. See package 
vignette for the definition of age acceleration residual. In addition, users 
are able to provide their own gene length using rowData(se). This is also
optional. If using `exprtype = "FPKM"`, the provided gene length will be 
ignored. If provided, the column name for gene length in rowData(se) should 
be "bp_length". The function will convert raw count to FPKM by the
user-supplied gene length. Otherwise, gene length is obtained from the
internal database. See below for an example of se object.}

\item{tissue}{a string indicate which tissue the gene expression data is
obtained from. Users are expected to provide one of the following tissues.
If the tissue argument is not provide or the provided tissue is not in this
list, then the age predictor trained on all tissues will be used to
calculate RNA age.
\itemize{
  \item adipose_tissue
  \item adrenal_gland
  \item blood
  \item blood_vessel
  \item brain
  \item breast
  \item colon
  \item esophagus
  \item heart
  \item liver
  \item lung
  \item muscle
  \item nerve
  \item ovary
  \item pancreas
  \item pituitary
  \item prostate
  \item salivary_gland
  \item skin
  \item small_intestine
  \item spleen
  \item stomach
  \item testis
  \item thyroid
  \item uterus
  \item vagina
}}

\item{exprtype}{either "counts" or "FPKM". For RPKM data, please use
`exprtype` = "FPKM".}

\item{idtype}{a string which indicates the gene id type in `exprdata`.
It should be one of "SYMBOL", "ENSEMBL", "ENTREZID" or "REFSEQ". Default is
"SYMBOL".}

\item{stype}{a string which specifies which version of pre-trained 
calculators to be used. It should be either "all" or "Caucasian". "all" 
means samples from all races (American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, 
Black/African American, and Caucasian) are used to obtain the 
pre-trained calculator. "Caucasian" means only the Caucasian samples are 
used to build up the pre-trained calculator.}

\item{signature}{a string which indicates the age signature to use when
calculating RNA age. This argument is not required. \cr
In the case that this argument is not provided, if `tissue` argument is also
provided and the tissue is in the list above, the tissue specific age
signature given by our DESeq2 analysis result on GTEx data will be used.
Otherwise, the across tissue signature "GTExAge" will be used. \cr
In the case that this argument is provided, it should be one of the
following signatures. A detailed description of the meaning of these
signatures is given in the package vignette.
\itemize{
  \item DESeq
  \item Pearson
  \item Dev
  \item deMagalhaes
  \item GenAge
  \item GTExAge
  \item Peters
  \item all
}}
}
\value{
a data frame contains RNA age.
}
\description{
This function takes SummarizedExperiment object as input and 
calculates RNA age.

\examples{
library(SummarizedExperiment)
data(fpkmExample)
colData = data.frame(age = c(40, 50))
se = SummarizedExperiment(assays=list(FPKM=fpkm), 
colData=colData)
res = predict_age_fromse(se = se, exprtype = "FPKM")
